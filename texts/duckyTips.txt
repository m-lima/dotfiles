* To remap keys on the Ducky
****************************************

1: Fn + 2 to switch to profile 2
2: Hold Fn + Ctrl until the indicator lights start to blink
3: Press Windows Key
4: Press Alt
5: Press Fn + Ctrl
Repeat for the same keys on the other side of the space bar. Then repeat everything again, but using Alt in step 3 and Windows Key in step 4.

Fn + L doesn't do right arrow on this particular keyboard by default, but I programmed it to do so, and I was then able to go to the end of the line by doing Cmd + Fn + L.
