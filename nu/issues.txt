- tmux does not capture the name of the running process (due to my fault, though)
- CTRL-SHIFT-R not working (nu is able to receive it, but not trigger the associated mapping)
- Lack of incremental history search
- Weird sizing when tmux changes the size of the pane
- CTRL-J nor working on windows over ssh
- Aliases are a bit of a hack to accommodate the fact you can't have an alias definition inside an `if`
- TAB does not complete until the largest common match (very used to it from zsh. Also useful when there is only one match left)
- VIM (not neovim) does not change the cursor (insert vs normal)
- Plugin manager (can really help to avoid having a duplicate zsh and nu scripts to load nali, simaplt, etc)
- When nesting ZSH inside NVIM inside NUSHELL, the TERM does not work properly (newlines and such)
